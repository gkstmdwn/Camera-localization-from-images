# Camera-localization-from-images
Using OpenCV to localize camera

1. Camera Calibration
 Using Checkerboard
 change chessboard size, frame size, size of chessboard squares, and the image directory
 
 From this, we can acquire Camera Matrix, 
 

2. You can calculate camera position using known pixel points, and world coordinates.
 In 3d Points, type in the World coordinates of the points, and in 2d points, type in the image coordinates(pixel) of the points.
